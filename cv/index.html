<h2>EXPERIENCES</h2>
<h3>Research Assistant Oct 2016 to now</h3>
<p>UC Davis Public Health Sciences Department Davis, CA</p>
<p>• Making data quality control, exploratory data analysis and hypotheses testing for clinical data related to Neuroradiology & Radiation
Oncology Radiation Necrosis with t test and mixed effects logistic regression using SAS.<p>
<h3>Data Scientist Intern Sep 2016 to now</h3>
<p>The UC Davis Center for Water-Energy Efficiency Davis, CA</p>
<p>• Analyzing water-use distribution and efficiency in different places in California with current available spatial and time series data,
interpolating missing values and forecasting groundwater levels with R package ‘spTimer’, which is usually for Spatio-Temporal
Bayesian Modeling, visualizing results with Tableau and making conclusions to support decisions around California water resources
allocation.</p>
<h3>SAS Programmer Intern Jun-Sep 2016</h3>
<p>Pfizer China Development and Research Center Shanghai, China</p>
<p>• Coded with SAS to get listings, tables and figures from clinical raw data of different modules according to SAP in a case study and wrote
macros for general application.</p>
<p>• Worked with CDARS, which is a standard reporting environment based on Pfizer Data Standards and includes many system macros that
can produce standard tables.</p>
<p>• Worked on a study using CDARS and made small demotions in particular cases like modification of variable names, lists of values with
wrong symbols, unplanned readings, and dates out of order. Also made QC for completed tables.</p>
